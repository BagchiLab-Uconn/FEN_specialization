Analysis of Differential effects on specialist vs generalist caterpillar
abundance, richness, and diversity.

This project contains analysis of data on caterpillar abundances from 32 sites 
in Eastern Connecticut, USA, collected between 2017 and 2019. Each site had 12
25 m^2 plots with 3 accompanying vegetation survey plots (100 m^2). Data
were also collected on the abundance and browsing damage by deer in each of the
sites. 

## Goals

* Quantify the effects of fragment area on the relative abundances of 
dietary specialist and generalist caterpillars.

* Determine the contributions of altered host availability and deer browsing
on shifts in caterpillar assemblages.

Data were analysed to determine

* Effects of fragment area on the relative abundances of specialist and 
generalist caterpillars.

* Effects of fragment area on the availability of host plants for the 
caterpillars

* Effects of deer prevalence and browsing on caterpillar abundances.


## Directory layout
* Analyses are stored in the [analyses](analyses/) directory.
* Data files are be stored inside the [data](data/) directory.
* Figures are stored in [figures](figures/) directory. 
* Tables are stored in [tables](tables/) directory. 


# List of Analyses:
* [Fragmentation](analyses/Fragmentation_Specialization.Rmd) - Does fragment
size differentially affect specialist abundance or richness?
* [map](analyses/FEN_map.R) Code to draw map of sites and plot layout.
